# exoBlade
A free, open source, modern, community maintained and ease-of-use hybrid Exo/Monolithic Kernel

# Experimental
Currently, this project is entirely experimental and a place for Stryxus to learn bare-metal programming for x86_64 and arm64. The learning of Rust, C and Assembly will also take place here. The current main branch will be moved elsewhere once the actual development beings.
This README is still being developed.

# Goal
The long-term goal is to have an easy to learn, easy to use kernel which supports direct interfacing with the metal itself while also providing optional abstractions and assisting libraries so as many people as possible can build upon exoBlade. Providing extensive documentation in the way you want either it be, extensive documentation or right to the point; giving you a window into the kernel and bare-metal world while not having much programming experience (Like one of those jobs which require you to have 5 years of experience for several things while also being an entry-level junior programming job).

The kernel will also provide a default CLI and GUI mode, however it will be very barebones, along the lines of Windows 98.

# The Problem
Kernels these days have been developed for decades, arguably over-developed; they have become confusing and overwhealming for the vast majority and bloated with very specific drivers and other code, or even kept entirely closed-source. Corporations, organisations and singular people have mainly dictated the entirety of the path of kernels and they have been catered for them and not really anyone else unless you want to dedicate a decade or so to learning them even though you are highly skilled technically.
